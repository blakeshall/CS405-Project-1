<h2>CS405 Project 1: Home Service Tracker</h2>

<h4><em>Author: Blake Hall</em></h4>

<h3>Description:</h3>

<h4>Technical Details</h4>

<p>This app is built in Ruby on Rails using the sqlite3 and pg gem for
database communication. In developement I used sqlite3 and then postgres
for production do to the hosting requirements. It is password protected
with basic HTTP Authentication with the username: demo and the password:
cs405g.</p>

<h4>Overview</h4>

<p>This is a web app that tracks multiple Services and their payments. Each
service is composed of a few attributes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Name: The name of the Service</li>
<li>Description: Just a general description of the service (optional)</li>
<li>Amount: The amount due for the service</li>
<li>Reoccuring: Whether the service is one-time only or monthly</li>
<li>Active: If the service is active, used for reoccuring services (default: true)</li>
</ul>

<p>These are up to the user to input, but a name and amount are required.
In addition there are three additional attributes for each service
created by Rails and the database: Service_id which is used by the
database as the primary key, created_at and updated_at timestamps.</p>

<p><em>NOTE:</em> I chose to not have any tables dropped. This is because if
you drop a service it will no longer appear on the reports. If it's a one time bill
it will not be charged again so it stays in the database for reporting purposes. In
case of reoccuring charges there is the option to deactivate it, because dropping it
would remove it from the year to date and monthly reports.<p>

<p>In addition to services it also tracks payments for each services.
Payments are comprised of:</p>

<ul>
<li>Amount: The amount paid for the service</li>
</ul>

<p>This is the only thing the user has control of. The database handles the
other attributes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Payment_id: the unique key for each payment</li>
<li>Service_id: Which service this payment belongs to</li>
<li>Created_at and Updated_at: timestamps generated and used by the
database</li>
</ul>

<p>The app provides validation so that no Service can be created without a
name or amount and a Payment cannot be created without an amount.</p>

<p>The app also provides the user with a number of Reports on payments a
services. In the Reports section the user can find three main reports:</p>

<h4>Unpaid</h4>

<p>All active services that are unpaid. It gives each service name and the
amount owed followed by the total amount owed.</p>

<h4>Year to Date</h4>

<p>Lists all the payments paid this year thus far. It includes the service
paid, the amount, and when the payment was made. It also gives a total
amount of all the payments.</p>

<h4>By Month</h4>

<p>Allows the user to search for payments in a specific month. "How much
did I spend in October?". The format is much like the Year to Date
report with the services paid, amounts, specific dates, and a total for
that month.</p>

<h3>Access and Installation</h3>
